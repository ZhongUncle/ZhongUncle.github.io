title: How to solve System Data too large on Mac (Xcode causes)?
excerpt: ""
---
Today I suddenly noticed that the "System Data" occupied over 100 GB, so I planned to clean it up. After investigation, I found that most of it from Xcode. (Generally, the software cache is in `~/Library`, so just find the largest directory or file in this directory)

macOS Monterey has added a new category "Developer" in "Storage Space - Management". You can clean up simulators and caches in it (Obviously, you can't clean up `~/Library` in here):

The largest directory in `~/Library` is `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/Previews/Simulator Devices`, which is about 72.4 GB. This directory is generated by using SwiftUI's Preview to run the simulator. Since it is not automatically cleaned, it will become very large over time. Preview is the part on the right side of the code below:

<img alt="Preview is the part on the right side of the code" src="/assets/images/f324cd7df8124278a55d8329aa9d308f.png" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

You can directly delete this directory, and when you next run Xcode and Preview, the directory will be re-generated.

Maybe you will see someone points out that `iOS DeviceSupport` and `iPad OS DeviceSupport` are different, but now you can clean up them through "Storage Space - Management".

However, sometimes deleting this directory may be not decrease the "System Data". Because sometimes the system mistakenly regards other files or documents as system cache. It may lead to errors in the displayed "System Data".

I hope these will help someone in need~
