title: The height of UIScreen.main.bounds occurs change (not right value)
excerpt: "Recently Apple changes UIScreen.main.bounds to wrong values, so I wrote this blog as addition (the original blog has also been modified)."

## Preface
I have wrote a blog that introduce two methods how to get the screen size of iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices: [How to get the screen size (bounds and nativeBounds) in Swift/SwiftUI](/blog/76cc2df1309fab57adb3429785b2d3c9.html), but recently Apple changes something, so I wrote this blog as addition (the original blog has also been modified).

## Reasons (I guess)
Recently, one of my open source project [ZhongUncle/SwiftUI_ImageCropper](https://github.com/ZhongUncle/SwiftUI_ImageCropper) received an issue saying that there was a bug. I don't think it is possible. But I still to test it, there was indeed a bug. After some research, I found that Apple had changed the value of `UIScreen.main.bounds.height`. But Apple has not officially mentioned this, it still refers to the boundaries of the entire screen. as follows:

![introduction of Apple document for UIScreen.main.bounds.height](/assets/images/ef8efb9e1367425e975ee7a51bbccca2.png)

Such as iPhone 11 Pro, the value of `UIScreen.main.bounds.height` has changed from 1125pt to 812pt, but `UIScreen.main.bounds. width` is still 375pt. You may think it is without safety area height, but the actual measurement is not that, it is the height of the entire screen.

I don’t know if it’s a bug or just modification. My personal guess is that it is a bug for two reasons:
1. Originally, the height-to-width ratio of iPhone 11 Pro was `3:1` for both `bounds` and `nativeBounds`. But the current `bounds` ratio is about `2.1:1`.
2. The value of `UIScreen.main.bounds.height` is 812pt, but the original value of `UIScreen.main.nativeBounds.height` of iPhone 11 Pro is 812px. So I doubt that the data is wrong.

Based on these suspicions, I report to Apple.

## Solution
In this case, if you use proportion to control the component size, it basically does not affect anything. But if you use specified values to control the size of components, or use the screen ratio, you need some solutions. Below are solutions for both (if you have any additions, please comment):
1. When using a specified value to control the size of a component, you need a `scale` to multiply the original value. The `scale` expression is `(UIScreen.main.bounds.height/UIScreen.main.bounds.width)/(UIScreen.main.nativeBounds.height/UIScreen.main.nativeBounds.width)`. Here we bring in the original screen height of the iPhone 11 Pro to verify: After calculating the `scale` of the iPhone 11 Pro, we get the rounded value `0.72177...` from `2.16533.../3`. Multiply it by the original height `1125` can get the current `812`.
2. For code that uses proportions, either be a little more troublesome and use different proportions for height and width, or use the first method. For example, the image cropper I made needs to use the size and proportion of the view in the image part. However, due to the change in the proportion here, a bug appeared, so different proportions were used for the height and width.

I hope these will help someone in need~
