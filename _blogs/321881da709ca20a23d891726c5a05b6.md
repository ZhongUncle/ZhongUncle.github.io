title: How to convert a number from some base to other base natively in Swift(for example, decimal to hexadecimal, octal to binary)
excerpt: "The is about how to convert a number from one base to another natively in Swift, a programming language. For example, decimal to hexadecimal, octal to binary, etc.The page introduces a method of the String type that can do the conversion easily. The method is String(a, radix b, uppercase c), where a is the source value, b is the target base, and c is a boolean value to indicate whether to capitalize the letters in the output.The page also explains how to write numbers in different bases natively in Swift. The prefixes are 0b for binary, 0o for octal, 0x for hexadecimal, and nothing for decimal."

Recently, I need to read some old documents. In the old documents, the memory address is in octal instead of hexadecimal, so I need to write a small tool to convert. Although the Mac built-in calculator can do it, but it is troublesome when there are too many.

At first, I want to write 12 conversion functions. Although some functions can be re-used, it is still quite laborious. So I looked for a simple method. Finally I found the `String` type has a particularly magical method, like:

```swift
String(a, radix: 16, uppercase: true)
```

The meaning of each parameter is as follows:
1. `a` here is the source value, you can also write a number directly here.
2. `radix:` is followed by the size of the target base, which supports 2~36, meaning from 2 to 36 base.
3. The `uppercase:` is not required. It is used to capitalize the letters in some binary output.

For example, the following code converts decimal to 32 base and capitalizes the letters in the output:

If you want to change the base of your input numbers, Swift supports 4 natively supported bases:
1. Add `0b` in front of the number to indicate binary, such as `0b1011`;
2. Add `0o` in front of the number to indicate octal, such as `0o240`;
3. Add `0x` in front of the number to indicate hexadecimal, such as `0x12F` (the `F` here can be uppercase or lowercase);
4. Nothing before the number to indicate decimal, such as `123`.

I hope these will help someone in need~
