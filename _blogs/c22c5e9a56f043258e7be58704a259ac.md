title: New Navigation mode in SwiftUI from iOS 16
excerpt: "From iOS 16, Apple start to deprecate NavigationView ZhongUncle introduces how to use new NavigationStack and NavigationSplitView how it works and similar things"
---
From iOS 16, Apple start to deprecate the original `NavigationView` and will gradually phase it out completely in the future. Apple start to use `NavigationStack` and `NavigationSplitView`. 

Recently, if you use `NavigationView` on iPadOS, the content will be placed in the sidebar, instead of like iOS or before, as follows:

`NavigationStack` is same as  `NavigationView`. `NavigationSplitView` is same as iPadOS `NavigationView`.

I guess Apple's purpose is to distinguish the two navigation modes. So let me introduce the new modes.

## NavigationStack
The usage of `NavigationStack` is exactly the same as `NavigationView`, just change the name. So it is very convenient to update the old code (**But effect is different**):

```swift
NavigationStack {
	NavigationLink...
}
```

**Notice: It only supports iOS 16 and later systems**. Therefore, when modifying the code, you should change to the following style, otherwise the your App can only support iOS 16 and later:

```swift
if #available(iOS 16.0, *) {
	// New code
	
} else {
	// Compatible with older systems
}
```

`NavigationStack` is equivalent to `NavigationView` with the following setting:

```swift
NavigationView {
    NavigationLink...
}
.navigationViewStyle(.stack)
```

## NavigationSplitView
`NavigationSplitView` is new and aims to facilitate developers to implement sidebars. It's actually really convenient.

Code likes:

```swift
NavigationSplitView {
    // Col 1  of sidebar
} content: {
    // Col 2 of sidebar
} detail: {
    // View
}
```

例如下面这段代码的样式如下：

```swift
NavigationSplitView {
	Text("1")
} content: {
	Text("2")
} detail: {
	Text("3")
}
```

In portrait:

In landscape:

Next, let’s talk about the data flow of the new `NavigationSplitView` through the following code:

```swift
struct MainView: View {
    let colors: [Color] = [.purple, .pink, .orange]
    @State private var selection: Color? = nil // In default, no selected color
    var body: some View {
        NavigationSplitView {
                List(colors, id: \.self, selection: $selection) { color in
                    NavigationLink(color.description, value: color)
                }
            } detail: {
                if let color = selection {
                    Rectangle()
                        .foregroundColor(color)
                } else {
                    Text("Pick a color")
                }
            }
    }
}
```

It will shows:

![sidebar has button](/assets/images/4fd62f5d747a4b4e8cd0c5eae9eebfc5.png)

Press "pink" button:

![Press "pink" button, View become pink](/assets/images/0829be5f676f49b5bc8b41ca52bac223.png)


I hope these will help someone in need~
