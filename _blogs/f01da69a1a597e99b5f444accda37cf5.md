Using Go to get URL parses is easy, but Go has strict package manage. So recommend you use `goimports` tools or shortcut key "Command + S" to auto complete the package. Because now use `"net/url"` or `"net/http"`, but in future maybe change.

Example URL is `https://www.example.com/?keyword=abc&id=12`.

Next, `url.Parse()` will parse the above URL and set error information. Finally, declare the variable `q` to obtain the parses:
 
```go
u, err := url.Parse("https://www.example.com/?keyword=abc&id=12")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
q := u.Query()
```

`u.Query()` mapped parse names and values. Since there may be multiple identical parse names, the values here is a string array. You can get the parses through `q`:

```go
fmt.Println(q["keyword"])
fmt.Println(q["id"])
```

Output:

```
[abc]
[12]
```

Let me explain some troubles when you use it.

### How to convert parse string to integer
The `q["keyword"]` or `q["id"]` here is actually a string array, so if you want to convert the value `12` of `id` to integer, you have to use the following method (if you have multiple `id` parses, choose which you want):

```go
id := strconv.Atoi(q["id"][0])
```

Now, the `id` value is the integer `12`.

### Determine whether there are parses or a specfied parse
Generally, parses are used for calculation or judgment, but what if we want to judge whether there is a parse part or whether there is a specfied parse?

There are two options:

The first method is check whether `q` or a specfied parse is empty, as follows:

```go
// check whether have parse
if q != nil {
	...
}
// check whether have parse `id`
if q["id"] != nil {
	...
}
```

The second method is that check the length of `q` or some parses by `len()`:

```go
// check whether have parse
if len(q) != 0 {
	...
}
// check whether have parse `id`
if len(q["id"]) != 0 {
	...
}
```

I hope these will help someone in need~
