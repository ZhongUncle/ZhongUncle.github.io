title: What are argc and argv of arguments of function main in C?
excerpt: "What are argc and argv of arguments of function main in C? It is a key for C program."

Create a new macOS platform Command Line Tool in Xcode and use C language. You will find that main takes two parameters: `argc` and `argv`. as follows:

![Two parameters of main: argc and argv](/assets/images/b1c22d7bcb28418fbe83e1642563315b.png)

`argc` is the number of command line parameters invoked by the program, used to count the number of parameters. This will cause you to have a misunderstanding, which is detailed in the `argv[]` section below. **It should be noted that although some programs support combined programs such as `-abcd`, C will consider them as one and need to be changed manually. **

`argv` needs to be explained in detail here. The previous writing was too concise. Some people did not understand the comments. There are some underlying logic that need to be explained.

The previously written version is:

> `argv` is a pointer to a string array. The array contains parameters. Each string is a parameter, and the last element is `0`. However, it is generally customary to use multi-level pointers to operate strings.

Now it seems that it is indeed too concise, and many people are not clear about arrays and pointers. Let’s explain it in detail below, and finally reflect on it.

`char *argv[]` means that `argv[]` is an array that stores the address of character type elements, because C has the concept of string: each character is stored in a char array, and the last element is `\0 `indicates the end of the string. `printf(%s)` is the output string. And generally use the `argv` pointer to access and process the contents of the `argv[]` array.
In C language, an array is a pointer plus an offset. So `argv` is a pointer to a pointer array `argv[]`. It can be used directly without definition.
The pointers stored in the `argv[]` array point to various parts of the input command (caller, options, parameters). The command entered in the Shell is split by judging spaces, then the header address of the string is put into the `argv[]` array, and finally a `0` is placed, indicating a null pointer.
For example, if the Shell input is `echo hello, world!`, then there are 4 pointers stored in the `argv[]` array:
1. A pointer whose value is the header address of `echo\0`;
2. A pointer whose value is the header address of `hello,\0`;
3. A pointer whose value is the header address of `world!\0`;
4. Null pointer `0`.

It is easy to judge if there are parameters directly after the calling program like this, just start the second one in the array.
But many programs need to judge situations, that is, options. How should developers judge options and parameters?
It is generally customary to use multi-level pointers to operate strings. The predecessors were very smart and took advantage of this to invent "UNIX-style" commands, such as `ls -s .`. In this command, a dash `-` is added in front of the option, so that the two can be distinguished.
According to the UNIX code convention, directly skip the first one, and then determine whether the first character of the string pointed to by the pointer is `-`. If so, then enter a `switch` judgment and use `case` to list multiple What code should be executed if this is supported. For example, you can determine options and process parameters as follows:

```c
int c;
while (--argc > 0 && (*++argv)[0] == '-' {
	while (c = *++argv[0] {
		switch(c){
			case 'x':
			...
			break;
			case 'n':
			...
			break;
			default:
			printf("xxx: illegal opyion %c\n", c);
			...
			break;
		}
	}
}
```

Finally, think about why some people couldn't understand your previous version, sentence by sentence. The original screenshot is as follows:

**"`argv` is a pointer to a string array that contains the parameters": **"argv" to many people is the array itself. But generally, if you say "argv" alone, you are referring to the pointer to the array. If it refers to an array, it needs to be represented by "array argv", "argv array", or "`argv[]`". Because as mentioned before, arrays are implemented using pointers. Moreover, I added a code style to the original text. If it is in the code, `argv` is directly expressed as a pointer. And in general code, arrays are used directly through pointers. But after I also asked my friends, I realized that many people don't know this, and I still need to explain this kind of thing in detail in the future.
**"Each string is a parameter, and the last element is `0`":** The problem with this sentence is that there is a bit of ambiguity, and too many things are omitted (you can see it from the explanation above). What I mean is "When the program runs, it will automatically split the string obtained from the input into multiple strings, and then store these strings in the argv array. The last element in the array is stored as a null pointer `0`". The reason for the ambiguity is the use of subordinate clauses. Using subordinate clauses in Chinese does cause this problem, so be careful in the future.
**"However, it is generally customary to use multi-level pointers to operate strings":** This belongs to me and is only used as a note. If someone has not read some source code, they will not be able to understand what is being said. The psychological estimate is "you Who knows this? mp4". Therefore, I will explain it in detail in the future and keep it as a record. Otherwise, if I remember what happened now, I won’t be able to understand it in a year or two.

I hope that these problems will not appear again in the blog in the future, and I would like to apologize to those who opened this blog before and did not get the solution.

​I hope these will help someone in need~
