Sometimes for learning or debuging, I need to view the assembly code of the program. This is very convenient in many GUI IDEs. For example, in Xcode, just click "Product"-"Perform Action"-"Assemble File Name", as follows:

How to implement it in the terminal?

First create a C file `test.c`. The content is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Then use the following command:

```bash
$ cc -S test.c
```

it will generate a file named as `test.s`, which contains assembly language, as follows:

I hope these will help someone in need~
