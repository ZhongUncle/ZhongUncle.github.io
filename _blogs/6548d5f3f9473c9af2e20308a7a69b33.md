title: How to generate assembly code using Clang 
excerpt: "This blog explains how to generate assembly code using Clang, a compiler for C and other languages. ZhongUncle shows how to use the cc -S command to create a file with assembly language from a C file. ZhongUncle also provides a screenshot of the assembly code and the C code. ZhongUncle hopes that this post will help someone who needs to view the assembly code of their program."

Sometimes for learning or debuging, I need to view the assembly code of the program. This is very convenient in many GUI IDEs. For example, in Xcode, just click "Product"-"Perform Action"-"Assemble File Name", as follows:

<img alt="Assembly code generated by Xcode" src="/assets/images/93db5877530445b2a632510ff74b7bfc.png" style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px">

How to implement it in the terminal?

First create a C file `test.c`. The content is as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Then use the following command:

```bash
$ cc -S test.c
```

it will generate a file named as `test.s`, which contains assembly language, as follows:

I hope these will help someone in need~
