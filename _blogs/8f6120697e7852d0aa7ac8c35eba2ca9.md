Before start to introduce, something be emphasized: This method does not guarantee to view all hard disks. Some hard disks will display "Resource busy" due to some reasons, such as Time Machine and built-in hard disks.

Supplies:
1. Mac;
2. Program `hexdump` 
3. Program `dd`

We will use `dd` to dump the content of disk, and we can view something:

```
$ sudo dd if=/dev/disk4 count=100000 | hexdump -C > disk.txt
```

Here are some explanations:
1. You must use `sudo` to obtain permissions, otherwise you cannot open hard disk file in `/dev/`. This is different from some Linux distributions.
2. `dd` is a program that is often used to copy hard disks and systems in byte format, so we can use it to output.
3. `if=/dev/disk4` is the path of the input file, and `/dev/disk4` here is the hard disk we want to view. Notice: **It must be a hard disk, not a partition**. If you can't distinguish this, then please read my other blog ["How to use terminal commands to mount and uninstall an external hard drive in macOS (exploration of the use of diskutil command and APFS format)"](/blogs/53937ce484ce9fcae747fc78a53b7953.html)'s "Extended Knowledge" section.
4. `count=100000` means outputting 100000 blocks. If you just want to see some information about the file system, then only using 1000 is almost enough.
5. After output, we will use `hexdump -C` to read it. `hexdump` is a program for viewing files in hexadecimal on the terminal. `-C` will display the corresponding characters on the right side.
6. ` > disk.txt` will output a file named `disk.txt` to view conveniently.

```

Other systems also can use this method, the difference is the path of disk devices. In Linux, it is in `/mnt/` usually.

I hope these will help someone in need~
