title: 「Updating」The syntax style of Apple's as assembler (different from the language style of Microsoft's masm assembler)
excerpt: ""
---
The syntax and style of assembly has two kinds in usual: AT&T and Intel syntx.

`as` is Apple's assembler. The assembly code generated by Xcode is AT&T syntax (Unix birthplace). The Microsoft's `masm` style that most people learned in college is Intel syntax (You know, it is "Wintel"), so this blog will shows some differences between them. However, there are too many details to write out all the differences at once, so I will continue to update them.

You may find a manual called "Mac OS X Assembler Guide", but this manual is from 2005 and was written for the transition to Intel. But many things have changed now, and the current `as` manual was last updated on April 23, 2020, which is the day the M1 debuted.

## Register expression
In Intel syntax like `masm`, registers are written directly, for example:

```
mov eax, ebx
```

But in AT&T syntax like `as`, in order to not be confused with the identifier (usually it is called as variable), you need to add a percent sign `%` in front of the register, and it must be lowercase. as follows:

```
movq    %rsp, %rbp
```

## Command parameters (the most important difference)
**This is the most important difference!** In `masm`, the assembly instruction representing `a=a+b` is as follows:

```
add a, b
```

will add the latter to the former.

But in `as`, the assembly instruction indicating `a=a+b` is the following structure:

```
add b, a
```

It is executed directly in sequence.

## Value of instruction
In `masm`, if you want to set a numerical parameter, such as `10`, you can write:

```
mov a, 10
```

But in `as`, you need to add `$`:

```
mov $10, a
```

It is few troublesome, but you can use parentheses to perform some simple calculations, as follows:

```
mov $(2*5), a
```

## Address offset
In `masm`, if you want to represent an address offset (in many cases, it represents the address of a variable), as follows:

```
mov eax, [ebp+8]
```

But in `as`, its format is `offset (base register, subscript register, scaling)`, which looks very complicated, but the most actual situation is simple as follows:

```
movl %edi, -4(%rbp)
```

## Hexadecimal notation
In `masm`, hexadecimal numbers has suffix `H` or `h`, such as `5c0dH`. But in `as`, it needs to be written with prefix `0x`, such as `0x1234`.
