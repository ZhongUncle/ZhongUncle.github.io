UIDevice is an API for obtaining device information. We need add `.current` to get current device information. Such as:

```swift
let name = UIDevice.current.name
```

It will display the device name ("General-About This xxx-Name"), such as "xxx's iPhone".

It has some other properties:
- `.name`: device name ("General-About This xxx-Name"), for example: xxx's iPhone.
- `.model`: Model of device, for example: iPhone 11 Pro.
- `.localizedModel`: It is the same as `.model`, but it will become a localized string (as a localized string).
- `.systemName`: System name, for example: iOS.
- `.systemVersion`: Specific version number, for example: 14.4.


For battery, it can display the status or level.

First turn on `isBatteryMonitoringEnabled` use the following (Here is two types:

```swift
var batteryLevel: Int {
    UIDevice.current.isBatteryMonitoringEnabled = true
    let data = Int(UIDevice.current.batteryLevel * 100)
 
    return data
}

// Function
func battery() -> Int {
    // Enable isBatteryMonitoringEnabled
    UIDevice.current.isBatteryMonitoringEnabled = true
 
    // Obtain battery level (in Float, the range is 0-1, here multiplied by 100 and converted into integer form)
    let batterylevel = Int(UIDevice.current.batteryLevel * 100)
    
    // Return level
    return batterylevel
}

// Closure
let battery = { () -> Int in
    // Enable isBatteryMonitoringEnabled
    UIDevice.current.isBatteryMonitoringEnabled = true
 
    // Obtain battery level (in Float, the range is 0-1, here multiplied by 100 and converted into integer form)
    let batterylevel = Int(UIDevice.current.batteryLevel * 100)
    
    // Return level
    return batterylevel
}
```

And we can use the returned value:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack{
            Text("\(battery())")
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

Now we can see the battery level. 

I hope these will help someone in need~
