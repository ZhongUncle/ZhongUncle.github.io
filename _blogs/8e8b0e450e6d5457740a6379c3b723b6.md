title: How to directly use scripts in Linux (configure all bin directories included in the $PATH variable)
---
<!-- excerpt-start -->
In Linux, when we write a script, we must use an explicit path to use the script, for example: `./helloworld`. If enter `helloworld` directly, we will be prompted `Command 'helloworld' not found`, which is very inconvenient.

The reason is the system automatically searches all `bin` directories contained in the `$PATH` environment variable to find the commands used. We look at the `$PATH` and see:

```bash
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```

These directories are separated by colons. For example, use `nano` will searched and found `/bin/nano`.

所以我们需要在我们的用户目录`~`下创建一个`bin`目录，并且将脚本移入该目录下（如果你的变量`$PATH`中有`/home/username/bin`目录，也就是`~/bin`目录，那就可以直接使用，不用接下来的操作）：
So we need to create a `bin` directory under our user directory `~` and move the script into this directory (if there is a `/home/username/bin` or ` ~/bin` directory in your variable `$PATH`, you can use it directly without the below operation):

```bash
$ mkdir bin
$ mv helloworld bin
```

Add below to `~/.bashrc` file (if there is not `~/.bashrc`, create one):

```bash
export PATH=~/bin:"$PATH"
```

But now you will notice that using command directly still doesn't work, beacuse `bin` created is not in `$PATH`. We can **quit terminal and reopen** or **reboot**, system will automatically add it to `$PATH`. If not convenient to reboot, you can use below command to active:

```bash
$ source .bashrc
```

or

```bash
$ . .bashrc
```

`.` is the same as the `source` command. It is a built-in command of the shell to read a specified shell command and treat it as keyboard input.

I hope these will help someone in need~
