This blog was originally published on 2021-02-07 17:12:03, but due to a modification (or say a bug, which I has been reported) discovered on 2022-11-6, so I add something about that. For details, please see: [The height of UIScreen.main.bounds occurs change (not right value)](/blogs/61e1734bb3ddb9aa2873dbcca4cc8a49.html)â€‹.

## bounds
**There are something you must notice, please check the link above.**

```swift
var screenBounds:CGRect = UIScreen.main.bounds
```

The unit of `UIScreen.main.bounds` is point. 

```swift
var width: CGFloat = UIScreen.main.bounds.width
var height: CGFloat = UIScreen.main.bounds.height
```

Now you can get screen size in CGFloat. You can use this value to drawing some UIs, such as drawing grids and moving the position of components.

The reason why `bound` for drawing and moving component positions is View generally uses CGFloat format data for operations. If you use `nativeBounds`, there is no way to operate because points and pixels is not one-to-one correspondence. And because the range is slightly "loose", this can effectively avoid errors caused by rounding during calculation.

## nativeBounds

```swift
var screenBounds: CGRect = UIScreen.main.nativeBounds
```

`nativeBounds` is in pixel. 

```swift
var width: CGFloat = UIScreen.main.nativeBounds.width
var height: CGFloat = UIScreen.main.nativeBounds.height
```

Use this method you can get size in CGFloat, but usually use it to get the size of some View or entire screen. Drawing View or move components do not use it usually.

Below is the values of iPhone 11 Pro:

|  | bounds | nativeBounds |
|-|-|-|
| width | 375 |	812 |
| height | 1125 | 2436 |

I hope these will help someone in need~
