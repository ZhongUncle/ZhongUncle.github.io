Today I accidentally discovered that the Siri calculator on iPad has accuracy issues in calculations, such as integer operations. I don’t know what is ignored.

For example, when calculating the square of 0.4, the result is approximately equal to 0.16 (why is it "approximately equal to"?). Then "1 - 0.4 squared is approximately equal to 0.83 (it is outrageous)".
