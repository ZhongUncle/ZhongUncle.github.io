Recently, I plan to use the open source and free SQLite as a database to save money. And due to personal habits, I prefer the command line, so I record how to use SQLite in command line.

For installation, macOS comes with sqlite3, and Linux can use the software package (`apt-get` or `yum`) to download.

## Brief introduction to SQLite interactive operations
Here are some small operations outside of the database.

For example in macOS, after opening "Terminal", enter the following command to open a database (if there is not one, a new one will be created):

```bash
sqlite3 database_name.db
```

At this time, you will enter the sqlite operation interface, like:

```bash
$ sqlite3 test.sql
SQLite version 3.36.0 2021-06-18 18:58:49
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> 
```

使用`.help`来查看**点操作**，例如保存成新文件，修改显示模式等，如下（有空了我会翻译一下这部分内容的）：
Use `.help` to view **click operations**, such as saving as a new file, modifying the display mode:

```bash

```

If you want to exit SQLite, we can enter `.exit` or press **Control + D** to exit. Like:

```bash
sqlite> .exit
```

**Notice: except for point operations, other commands must end with a semicolon (;), otherwise SQLite will think that the command has not ended, and the following situation will occur:**

```bash
sqlite> CREATE TABLE tbl2 (
   ...> 
```

In this case, we can enter a semicolon to indicate the end of the command, or we can use this to enter a long command, such as the following:

```bash
sqlite> CREATE TABLE tbl2 (
   ...>   f1 varchar(30) primary key,
   ...>   f2 text,
   ...>   f3 real
   ...> );
sqlite>
```

## Create a new table in the database
After basic operations, now we can start to understand the four major database skills: addition, deletion, modification and search.

But we have to create a new table. Here we create a new 2-column table. The first column is named `one`, the data type is `varchar` (a character type), and the maximum number of characters is 20; the second column is named `two` in `smallint` (an integer type), the command is as follows:

```bash
sqlite> create table tbl1(one varchar(10), two smallint);
```

The name of table is `tbl1`.

## Add, delete, modify and check
"**Add**" here is to insert a piece of data, the method is as follows:

```bash
sqlite> insert into tbl1 values('hello!',10);
sqlite> insert into tbl1 values('goodbye', 20);
```

Here we insert two rows of data. Then check the table (here shows the previous and modified content and style):

```bash
sqlite> select * from tbl1;
hello!|10
goodbye|20
sqlite> .mode column
sqlite> select * from tbl1;
one      two
-------  ---
hello!   10 
goodbye  20 
```

"**Delete**" is to delete one or more rows of data that meets specified requirement. For example, use the following command to delete the row where is `hello` in the `one` column:

```bash
sqlite> delete from tbl1 
   ...> where one='hello'
   ...> ;
sqlite> select * from tbl1;
one      two
-------  ---
goodbye  20 
```

Then we insert several pieces of data as follows to demonstrate deleting multiple pieces of data:

```bash
one      two
-------  ---
goodbye  20 
a        20 
b        20 
c        10 
c        20 
```

Let's try:

```bash
sqlite> delete from tbl1
   ...> where two=20;
sqlite> select * from tbl1;
one  two
---  ---
c    10 
```

You can see all rows where column `two` equal to `20` have been deleted. **You may also see that the value in string format needs to be enclosed in single quotes, and the integer can be directly equal to it.**

**Change** means updating the data, but this also reminds us to add a column with unique data, such as id. But I won’t add it here, because it is just a demo. We change **c** in the first column to **abc**. The command is as follows:

```bash
sqlite> update tbl1
   ...> set one='abc'	# target value
   ...> where two=10;	# Filters
sqlite> select * from tbl1;
one  two
---  ---
abc  10 
```

**Check** is to select data that meets some conditions and display.

For example, if we search for data with value of `two` less than 20 in the `tbl1` table, use the following command:

```bash
sqlite> select *
   ...> from tbl1
   ...> where two<20
   ...> ;
one  two
---  ---
abc  10 
```

Okay, now we can start to use SQLite. I will slowly write some skills into a separate blog.

I hope these will help someone in need~
