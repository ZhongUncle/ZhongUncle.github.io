There are two types of output data formats: formatted output and direct output. For example, the `f` of `printf` function in C language means formatted. Different data types can be printed through conversions such as `%d`. Python also has two types.

In generally,  `str()` and `print()` functions are used for direct output (not only for direct output); there are many types of formatted output, we will talk about it later.

## Direct output
There are some ways to directly output:
### Expression
The results can be output directly through expressions, as follows:

```python
>>> 1+1
2
```

### str()
`str()` will directly output the content in parentheses as a string. as follows:

```python
>>> str(b'Zoot!')
"b'Zoot!'"
```

### print()
`print()` output in stringformat:

```python
# Output number
>>> print(123)
123
# Output string
>>> print("abc")
abc
# Output three variables at once with commas separated, then the output values ​​will be separated by space
>>> a=1
>>> b=2
>>> c="abc"
>>> print(a,b,c)
1 2 abc
# Output two values at once with commas separated, the output string will be separated by space 
>>> print("Hello","World!")
Hello World!
# Output two values at once, but without commas separating them, the output strings will be concatenated, no any separator
>>> print("Hello""World!")
HelloWorld!
# Output two values at once with commas separated, and set the separator to a period, then the output string will be separated by a period
# This can be used to output clearly formatted things such as URLs and paths (a little bit formatted)
>>> print("www","python","org",sep=".")
www.python.org
```

The complete arguments of `print()` function are as follows:

```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
```

The meaning of arguments:
 - `*objects`: Input objects, such as the previous `"Hello", "World!"`.
 - `sep=' '`: separator, it must be a string. The default value is a space `" "`. You also can set it to `None`.
 - `end='\n'`: Set the last delimiter of the string, which must be a string. The default is `\n`. You also can set it to `None`. If `*objects` is not given, then `print()` only outputs the content set by `end`.
 - `file`: Set the output location. The default setting here is `sys.stdout`.
 - `flush`: If `True`, then the data stream is forced to be flushed. This may be difficult to understand, but after running the following code, you should understand:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import time

print("--- Loading ---")

print("Loading",end = "")
for i in range(20):
    # Change the False to True, you will know how flush work
    print(".",end = '',flush = False)
    time.sleep(0.5)
```

## Formatted output
We have talked about setting the delimiter mentioned previously in `print()`, it may be called as a formatted output. Except it, there are several ways to format the output.

#### Formatted String Literals
Formatted String Literals, aka f-strings. Use `f` or `F` before the opening single or triple quote, and you can write Python expressions in a string between a pair of curly braces to reference variables or literal values.

Here are some offical samples:

Simple reference variables:

```python
>>> year = 2016
>>> event = 'Referendum'
>>> f'Results of the {year} {event}'
'Results of the 2016 Referendum'
```

Controls the digits of precision, here we set 3 decimal digits:

```python
>>> import math
>>> print(f'The value of pi is approximately {math.pi:.3f}.')
The value of pi is approximately 3.142.
```

Setting an integer after `:` will set the minimum digits of the number, which can align column.

```python
>>> for name, phone in table.items():
...     print(f'{name:10} ==> {phone:10d}')
... 
Sjoerd     ==>       4127
Jack       ==>       4098
Dcab       ==>       7678
```

#### str.format()
This method like `print()`, but put the referenced arguments ​in `.format()`, as follows:

```python
>>> yes_votes = 42_572_654
>>> no_votes = 43_132_495
>>> percentage = yes_votes / (yes_votes + no_votes)
# The content of single quotes is the `str` of `print()`, and the following `.format()` brackets are the corresponding arguments.
>>> '{:-9} YES votes  {:2.2%}'.format(yes_votes, percentage)
' 42572654 YES votes  49.67%'
```

Here is for number:

```python
>>> print('We are the {} who say "{}!"'.format('knights', 'Ni'))
We are the knights who say "Ni!"
```

This is default, and you also can use the symbol corresponding to the argument to reference it. The first string in the brackets corresponds to the number `0`, and so on. As follows:

```python
>>> print('{0} and {1}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))
spam and eggs
>>> print('{1} and {0}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))
eggs and spam
```

You can also use keyword arguments to reference the value by the name of the arguments, as follows:

```python
>>> print('This {food} is {adjective}.'.format(
...       food='spam', adjective='absolutely horrible'))
This spam is absolutely horrible.
```

Combine them:

```python
>>> print('The story of {0}, {1}, and {other}.'.format('Bill', 'Manfred',other='Georg'))
The story of Bill, Manfred, and Georg.
```

You also can access variables value from a table by referencing the index or the name. Enclose the variable name with square brackets `[]`. As follows:

```python
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}
# Enclose the variable name with square brackets `[]`
>>> print('Jack: {0[Jack]:d}; Sjoerd: {0[Sjoerd]:d}; '
...       'Dcab: {0[Dcab]:d}'.format(table))
Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678
```

It is not convenient to write a `0` with the square brackets `[]`, so you can use two asterisks `**` to simplify it. As follows:

```python
>>> table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 8637678}
>>> print('Jack: {Jack:d}; Sjoerd: {Sjoerd:d}; Dcab: {Dcab:d}'.format(**table))
Jack: 4098; Sjoerd: 4127; Dcab: 8637678
```
