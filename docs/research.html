                <p>BDMV is the format used by Blu-ray discs. This format cannot be played using playback software, and a hard disk player, which is a specialized device, must be used. But the most classic ffmpeg can convert it to other formats and maintain the same bit rate and definition, so that it can be viewed easily.</p>

Then I have new problem: Why GIFs shows animations, but be classified as static images?</p>

                <p>Recently, I need to learn Java. Due to personal habits, I just want to use the terminal for development instead of using an IDE. But I never expected that I would be tricked by the official website once, and the downloaded Java could not be developed normally. So I wrote this article to explain how to configure it. It's very simple, just find the right official website.</p>

                <p>Maybe you like me have a question: Why heap sorting using a binary tree, but it is called heap sorting, rather than tree sorting? Because the predecessor of heap sort is called Tree Selection Sorting, it also uses a tree structure, but is slightly simpler. Finally we will talk about why invent heap sorting to replace tree sorting.</p>

Because R can output very nice charts for publication. It may not be necessary for blogs, but it is necessary for publications such as papers and books.
