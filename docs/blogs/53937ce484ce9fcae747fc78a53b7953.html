                <p class="info">2023-08-14 ｜ <a href="/research.html"> Research</a> ｜ #Words: 2112 </p>
            </div>
            <p>This article aims to provide a low-level explanation of APFS, the file system used by Apple devices. Because I noticed that there was a lack of documentation on how APFS works in details, so I do some research and share my findings.</p>

<h2 id="tip">Tip</h2>
<p>Don’t confuse partitions in APFS with the conception of partitions in Windows. In APFS, a Volume is shown in the Finder, but it is not a direct partitions of the hard disk. There is an intermediate layer called container, which can contain multiple volumes. This is different from the Windows partition concept, each partition is a separate disk space directly in Windows.</p>

<h2 id="apfs-structure">APFS structure</h2>
<p>The internal structure of APFS is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/8c1c047800b0450ebdb6b1c9795f0677.png" alt="APFS structure" /></p>

<p>The diagram above shows only one volume, and then describes each part of volume. The “objects” in “Storage for objects and file data” includes the storage disk what we see in Finder, which is also called as volume.</p>

<p>The abbreviation of “GUID partition table” is GPT, which is well-known to many people on Windows (not the chatbot), and GPT partition is part of the EFI technology (EFI aka UEFI, invented by Intel).</p>

<p>Each container of APFS is arranged in order on the hard disk, without any gaps, which is different from Windows’ GPT partition.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/00314bd8c51c4bce976482d02460c70f.png" alt="The free space of APFS is shared among all volumes, so it is easy to expand" /></p>

<p>This is also why on Windows you just can extend or adjust the size of the last partition, and not the previous (APFS’s free space is shared among the various volumes, so it’s easy to expand, as below). And why it takes a long time to create a new APFS partition on macOS (because it have to move the files from other partitions to the right place).</p>

<p>How does the system know that this container exists on the hard disk? Sequential reading can know the first container, but what about the second and others?</p>

<p>First of all, the system does not find the containers by sequential reading. This is the job of the GUID partition table at the beginning of the hard disk, which contains the start and end addresses of each partition. When needed, it just jumps to them, using a directory-like structure. As shown in the digram below (from the official standard <a href="https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/05_GUID_Partition_Table_Format.html">《GUID Partition Table (GPT) Disk Layout》</a>):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/faee30b2b1ce43ebb878cf971debbac1.png" alt="https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/05_GUID_Partition_Table_Format.html" /></p>

<p>You can see how partitions are divided and jump through the main partition table or the backup partition table.</p>

<p>If you look at the hexadecimal of an APFS formatted hard drive, you can see the following situation (note that the “GPT Header” part starts from line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">200</code>):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/4fb95fe4da7f4da5abde04e356b4b3e5.png" alt="Each parts of APFS" /></p>

<p>You can see the beginning of structure looks like other UEFI format device.</p>

<h3 id="protective-mbr">Protective MBR</h3>
<p>One difference between APFS and some other file systems using GPT partitions is that APFS has a Protective MBR section, regardless of whether they are boot disks or not.</p>

<p>The Protective MBR must be the first logical block on a hard disk that uses GPT partitions. This partition makes the computer think that the hard disk is usable and has been used, so it won’t pop up a window to ask you whether to partition, format, etc. The EFI itself does not use this block.</p>

<p>Protective MBR looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2f223bf420de4a769ea16205900ef73c.png" alt="Protective MBR" /></p>

<p>The meaning of each part as follows (the offset is from the beginning of this part and is also in hexadecimal):</p>

      <td>Remaining reserved portion of the logical block, set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code></td>
    </tr>

<p>If you have questions about the left index number, remember it is in hexadecimal. For example, the hexadecimal notation of the last <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">512</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">200</code>.</p>

<h3 id="gpt-header">GPT Header</h3>
<p>GPT Header is the core part of UEFI technology and GPT partition, which stores a lot of information. The various parts of GPT Header are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="gpt-partition-entry-array">GPT Partition Entry Array</h3>
<p>The GPT Partition Entry Array contains an array that stores GPT partition entries. I still explaining what each part is, here is the first entry in the GPT partition entry array:</p>

<p>Depending on operating system and partition, the value of the partition type GUID is also different. For example, the GUID value of the EFI system partition above is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">28 73 2a c1 1f f8 d2 11 ba 4b 00 a0 c9 3e c9 3b</code>. Sometimes you will see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B</code> in other documents, where each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> separates each part. The number above is little endian, you can calculate them correspondingly, they are same.</p>

<p>The partition type GUID of the APFS partition is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ef 57 34 7c 00 00 aa 11 aa 11 00 30 65 43 ec ac</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC</code></p>

<p>The meaning of each part in the above “Attributes” is as follows:</p>

      <td>Legacy BIOS Bootable</td>
      <td>This is left to systems with legacy PC-AT BIOS firmware to implement notifications of certain restricted, special-purpose software running on a system bootable from a GPT partition</td>

<p>You can see that in each entry in the GPT partition entry array, the starting and ending points are marked, so jump and obtain through these parts.</p>
