        <p>Pico has two I2C, namely two sets of SDA and SCL. You can see this from the names in the pin diagram. By default, only the first I2C (`I2C0`) is enabled. It means, even if you modify the pin, but not in `I2C0`, it still doesn't work. There are two ways to modify the SDA and SCL default pins of I2C correctly, and also there is a not recommended method (but still a useful method).</p>

        <p>Recently I received a Tang nano 9K FPGA development board as gift, so I wanted to take this opportunity to study FPGA. The official document recommand to use GOWIN IDE to develop GOWIN FPGA, but you need to apply for a license and submit a lot of information. Since it was a gift, So it is not convenient. In addition, IDE is actually not very suitable for learning and putting into production, because IDE hides many details. So I want to find other workflows, just like using any text editor and Clang/LLVM to compile C/C++ programs.</p>
