                <p>Sometimes you need to convert array subscripts and elements into a dictionary. For example, if you use array elements to search for subscripts, if you use a function to search, you have to perform a loop search and acquisition every time, which requires a lot of computing performance and memory. At this time, convert the original array into a dictionary, keyword For array elements, it would be more convenient if the value is a subscript serial number, so that the serial number can be easily found through the value of the element, and there is no need to perform a loop search every time.</p>

                <p>Starting from iOS 15.0, Apple has abandoned the previous.animation(Animation?) and recommends developers to use .animation(Animation?, value: Equatable) or withAnimation instead.Personally, I feel that although I may not be used to it after the revision, the possibilities and freedom of development are greater.But before talking about the difference between the two, we need to understand UI animation. You can skip this part if you understand it.What is animation.Animation is a process of attribute changes such as various displacements, color changes, size changes, etc.Specific to SwiftUI's View, it is their .offset, .foregroundC</p>

                <p>In the process of developing software, we not only need to perform operations when the user clicks, but sometimes we also need to automatically perform some operations at regular intervals. For example, the most common opening screen advertisement countdown is closed, as well as some animation effects. There are generally two ways to implement these: one is to use a timer, and the other is to use asynchronous operations.</p>
